# Maps for sites identification in Zambezia

This repository contains a simple webmap to highlight interesting areas to survey in Zambezia. The map is based on open data and approximations and is meant to give a realistic (and not an exact) idea of the situation. Only for demonstrative purposes.

The location and number of population was approximated based on [this settlement layer](https://grid3.org/resources/data) and this [population data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/highresolutionpopulationdensitymaps). This approximation is underestimating the real number of population.

The grid is an estimate of existing and planned medium voltage line in Zambezia.

The map is available [here](https://clippan.github.io/zambezia_survey_sites/)
